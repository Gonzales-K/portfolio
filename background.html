										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>

									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> 
										I'm a software engineer who is deeply passionate about the transformative power of programming to improve everyday life. 
										Whether it's simplifying workflows with innovative features or creating entirely new applications, 
										I firmly believe in technology's ability to make a positive impact.
										<br/><br/>
										My journey in software engineering has been marked by a continuous pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to delivering 
										high-quality solutions. My experience spans across diverse industries, including the medical and logistics sectors. The 
										thing that has stood out to me in every workplace is how much a single feature can impact the day to day lives of end-users
										and how that can also have a massive impact on the business. In fact that is what gave me the courage to make this career change.
										<br/><br/>
										As an ECG technician I experienced how the ability to zoom and invert the colors of the ecg tracing not only reduced eye-strain 
										but improved productivity. Simply because it was easier to see. In my logistics role, there was a process that took many hours 
										out of the day and was very prone to human error. I learned visual basic and built a tool that allowed me to complete my work 
										in less than half a day, take on more projects, and assist colleagues with their workload all with very little error.
										<br/><br/>
										Building that tool and seeing the impact was the most fulfilling experience of my professional life. It made me realize the 
										possibilities... and that I could contribute to those solutions. I get that feeling every time I come up against a programming 
										challenge and solve it. That's what makes me determined to make this work my future.
